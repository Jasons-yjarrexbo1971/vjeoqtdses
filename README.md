Just walked out of Final Destination: Bloodlines and, man, my head's spinning like one of those carnival rides that should probably be shut down for safety, ya know? The theater was chaos — Speaker static? Or ghosts whispering? Who knows, everything blurs when your heart's beating like a drum solo, can't even hear my own thoughts _jeez_.

Okay, breathe. Movie was insane — like a rollercoaster with unexpected dips, or like trying to untangle earphones in a hurry. There was this one scene, blood everywhere (classic), and I kept thinking about that time I dropped a burrito while wearing white. Just like that, though way more fatal ofc. And dude, the way the camera zooms in at the wrong moments, it’s like when a cat leaps unexpectedly onto your face — totally wild.

> Popcorn crumbs jabbing at my spine, but glued to the seat like it was soaked in honey. The theater, cold as a polar bear's dream — why don’t they ever get the temperature right in these places? I’d swear they use arctic winds as air conditioning... hello frostbite, my old friend.

There's a twist, oh boy, forgot it already. But it was clever like a raccoon stealing your trash. These  s, they always wanna play chess with your nerves. I wonder if they’ll 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   soon for the 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮𝘪𝘯𝘨 peeps — someone was asking me about that. Or was it 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   together later? Gosh, my brain’s Swiss cheese, now with extra holes.

The acting tho, like a salsa mix and truth serum, the terror real enough to crawl up your sleeves and tickle your elbows. Felt like an acupuncturist had a vendetta against my nerve endings. Why did my phone just vibrate? Random texts? Nope, it's just twitching like a fish on land. Oh wait. I mean, that final sequence where fate was this _huge_ mechanical spider of destiny... my mind's got cobwebs now.

Anyway, can't even process all this while my spine’s still yelling from that uncomfortable seat. It might just be time to sit on a couch with a back massage function and 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the memory away…

function makeFateHappen() {
  if (chaos) {
    return Oops, try later!;
  } else {
    var destiny = No way!;
  }
  destiny = destiny || What?;
}
